## Development

1. Run docker to have mongodb and redis ready

```shellscript
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Create the .env file from the .env.example file

npm run dev
```

4. To create the auction, make the POST API to /api/auction. You can use the attached postman collection in this repo for your convenience.

   Sample payload:
